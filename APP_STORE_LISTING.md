- Don't repeat words from app name
- Research competitor keywords

### Screenshot Best Practices
- Show actual app screens (not mockups)
- Add text overlays highlighting key features
- Use arrows or highlights to guide attention
- First screenshot should be most compelling
- Show different features in each screenshot

### Description Optimization
- Put most important features first
- Use emojis sparingly (they help but don't overdo)
- Include social proof if available ("Join thousands of parents...")
- Use bullet points for readability
- Include call-to-action at the end

### Promotional Text (iOS)
- Update frequently (doesn't require review)
- Highlight new features or promotions
- Keep it under 170 characters
- Use action words: "Join", "Get", "Experience"
